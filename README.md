# digit-classifier
A classifier trained on the MNIST dataset of handrawn numbers, capable of recognizing handrawn numbers between 0 and 9. This repo includes a homemade matrix math and neural netwrok library. The graphics (digits, graph, piechart, neural network) were all made using the p5.js graphics library.
